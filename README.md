# Chefbot

As a project for the class 'Assistenzsysteme' at the technical university of Deggendorf, Germany, I created this bot, which can help you with recipes and cooking ideas. It is connected to the chefkoch.de website with my own module python_chefkoch. As for now, it is only able to understand the german language.
